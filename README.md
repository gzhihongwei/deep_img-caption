# honors-thesis
This repository is for code relating to my honor's thesis at UMass Amherst. Specifically, this repo will contain code for image captioning, sequential image captioning, and ultimately text to image tasks. All code will be in python and PyTorch will be the deep learning framework of choice. Any datasets that will be used will also be contained here.
